I am the Morton E. Gurtin Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics in the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University.
I work on numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), scientific machine learning, and PDE-constrained optimization.

<b> Short Bio: </b> Before coming to Brown, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/casc" style="color:black">Center for Applied Scientific Computing</a> at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
<!-- where I am leading a three-year research project on PDE-constrained stochastic optimization methods for risk-averse engineering design. -->
Before that, I was a postdoc at the <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/" style="color:black">Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics</a>.
Before that, I was a postdoc at the Chair of Numerical Analysis at the Technical University of Munich, where I was supervised by <a href="http://www.professoren.tum.de/en/wohlmuth-barbara/" style="color:black">Barbara Wohlmuth</a>.
Before that, I was a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu/" style="color:black">Oden Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences</a>, where I was supervised by <a href="https://users.oden.utexas.edu/~leszek/" style="color:black">Leszek Demkowicz</a>.
